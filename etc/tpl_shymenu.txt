*shymenu.txt*  Show the menu bar only when pressing an accelerator key
               Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

shymenu will show the menu bar only when the user presses an accelerator 
key. The menu will be hidden again after an item was selected.
shymenu achieves this by defining key maps for those accelerator keys 
(see 'winaltkeys') that would normaly activate a menu.

On a terminal, shymenu will define accelerator keys for the |:emenu| 
command.

In order to use this plugin, remove "m" from 'guioptions' by adding 
something like this to your |vimrc| file, which will hide the menu bar 
by default: >

   set guioptions-=m

Many thanks to A Mechelynck for making me aware of 'wildcharm' and the 
trick with |:emenu|.
